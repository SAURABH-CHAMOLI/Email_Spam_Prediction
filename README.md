# Email Spam Detection
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect spam emails. The model is trained using a dataset of emails labeled as spam or non-spam. Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing:
Label Encoding: Converting categorical labels into numerical form.
Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical features.

Model Training:
Using a Logistic Regression model to classify emails as spam or non-spam.

Accuracy:
Attain the training accuracy of 96.70 %  and  testing accuracy of 96.77 %.

Deployment:
Creating a web interface using Flask.
Deploying the application on Render for live classification of incoming emails.
